# FridgeChef - Recipe Recommendation App

FridgeChef is an Android app that recommends recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. The app allows users to add ingredients to their virtual pantry either by typing them manually or through ingredient image recognition using the Logmeal API. Recipes are recommended via the Spoonacular API, and users can view recipe details and instructions in a step-by-step cooking mode. The app also includes a sharing system that allows users to share their favorite recipes via social media apps.

FridgeChef is a personal project created as part of my thesis for university. It aims to make cooking more accessible by leveraging technology to suggest recipes based on what users already have at home.
